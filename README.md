# My custom awesome config

Mostly just saving this for myself for later, but if you want to install it / copy parts of it feel free.

## Features

- Changes wallpaper to random image in '~/Pictures/papes' when a new tag/desktop is selected
- Disables several layouts I don't like
- Maybe more some day

## Installation

- First have [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org) installed
- Then just copy / paste (or git clone) the files into ~/.config/awesome
- Customize as you see fit
